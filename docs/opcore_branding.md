# OpCore Branding Guide: The "Brand Studio" Concept

## 1. Visual Identity: "Lagos Blue"
OpCore's primary visual language is built around **"Lagos Blue"**, a vibrant, trustworthy electric blue that signals reliability and modern finance.

### Color Palette
-   **Primary (Lagos Blue):** `#2252c9` (Tailwind: `blue-700` approx, but specific hex preferred)
-   **Surface:** White (`#ffffff`) or dark slate (`#0f172a`) for depth.
-   **Accents:**
    -   Success: Emerald Green (`#10b981`)
    -   Warning: Amber (`#f59e0b`)
    -   Error: Rose (`#f43f5e`)

## 2. The "Brand Studio" Philosophy
For business users, the "Settings" page is replaced by the **Brand Studio**. This is not just a form; it is the control center for their company's identity in the digital economy.

### Core Principles
1.  **Identity First:** The user isn't just changing a setting; they are defining *who they are* to the tax authorities and their customers.
2.  **Visual Feedback:** When a user uploads a logo or changes their brand color, the preview should be instant. They should see exactly how their invoice will look.
3.  **One Source of Truth:** The data here (Tax ID, Address, Sector) populates *everything*—from invoices to audit reports.

## 3. Component Design System
*   **Inputs:** Large, touch-friendly inputs (h-12) with floating labels or clear placeholders.
*   **Cards:** Content is grouped into distinct, purpose-built cards (e.g., "Company Details", "Visual Identity", "Compliance Profile").
*   **Glassmorphism:** Use subtle `backdrop-blur` overlays on marketing panels (like the Registration Left Pane) to create depth.

## 4. Typography
*   **Font:** Inter (Primary)
*   **Headings:** Bold, tracking-tight. High contrast against background.
*   **Data:** Monospace numbers for all financial figures (`font-mono`).
