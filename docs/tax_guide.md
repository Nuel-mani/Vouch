# NTA 2025 Tax & Compliance Guide

## Nigerian Tax Act (NTA) 2025 Overview
The 2025 Act introduces stricter digital evidence requirements and incentives for R&D-heavy businesses.

### 1. Mandatory Evidence Chain
- **Receipts**: All business deductions must be backed by a verifiable digital receipt stored in `receipt_urls`.
- **Authorization**: Transactions must record the `authorized_by` person to maintain an audit trail.
- **Payee Validation**: Payee names must match the registered Business Name on the invoice.

### 2. Tax Optimizer Logic
The OpCore Tax Optimizer looks for:
1. **Missing VAT Evidence**: Expenses without a PDF/Image receipt.
2. **Compliance Traps**: High-value transactions with missing payee details.
3. **R&D Credits**: Opportunities to claim deductions on innovation-related spending.

### 3. Financial Statements
All reports generated by OpCore are designed to be "Audit Ready," meaning they link directly to the underlying evidence in the database.
